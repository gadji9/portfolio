                    I live in the Republic of Dagestan.
                    <br />
                    Started programming at the age of 14. I loved to play games,
                    so i decided to become a game developer. Started with c#.
                    <br />
                    From video tutorials on the Internet, I learned enough
                    knowledge to create games on Unity. I was passionate about
                    this business and created games one by one. I posted one of
                    them on google play.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In search of an opportunity to monetize my activities, I
                    found a vacancy in a nearby city in Vue JS.
                    <br />
                    Therefore, I diligently began to study html css js.
                    Unfortunately, this job was not successful.
                    <br />
                    Within six months of studying, I was hired by spichka dev as
                    a backend developer. I got my second wind.
                    <br />
                    I really liked learning and communicating with my
                    colleagues, so in another half a year I became a full stack.
                    Since the tasks on the backend are over, I asked them to
                    give me tasks on the front. So I started my dive into React
                    JS. Since then, namely 2 years, I have been studying it and
                    trying to get better and better.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    English level - "B2" Also studied on my own.
                    <br />
                    <br />I actively follow the latest trends and changes in IT,
                    because for me this area is very interesting, and I am ready
                    to devote my life to it. Therefore, I am looking for a
                    strong team in which I could develop, learn new things, be
                    useful.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you need a motivated employee who is ready to develop and
                    become better every day, then feel free to get in touch with
                    me, I will be happy to answer ;)
